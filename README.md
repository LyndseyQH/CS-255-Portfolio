# CS-255-Portfolio

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

 DriverPass was the primary project throughout the semester. DriverPass aimed to address the issue of inadequate driving education. According to their findings, more than 65% of persons fail their DMV driving tests. The goal of this project was to improve driver training through online courses and in-person instruction.
  
What did you do particularly well?

This training has greatly improved my ability to analyze systems and visually represent abstract topics. The diagrams I made to explain classes, activities, sequences, and data flow truly helped me a lot, and I believe I executed them well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I'd like to enhance my UML class diagram. There is definitely space for improvement in terms of the procedures I detailed. The accessor methods were simple to capture, but the interconnected nature of the classes necessitates more thought and a deeper knowledge of how these objects would be leveraged to suit the system's users' demands. Including other ways that cover these concepts would be advantageous.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

From the beginning, I approached system design with user needs in mind. I created diagrams that represented possible user interactions. In terms of the class diagram, I used the sequence and activity diagrams to predict how each class will be used. Without thorough consideration for user demands, the system design may remain too abstract to produce any practical solutions to the problems it is meant to tackle.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

An iterative design approach was one of the most crucial skills I gained from this training. Using this strategy, I'm less concerned about recording all the details at first, which used to slow me down. I use several passes over a project, with each turn providing deeper insight and adding more information than the previous. In future projects, I plan to refine this technique.
